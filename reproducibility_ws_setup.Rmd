## Instructions for all users

1. Make sure that you have installed the [latest versions of R and RStudio](r_and_rstudio.html). 
2. Install the tidyverse and the renv packages by copying the following code into the Console, after the prompt `>`

  ```{r install-tidyverse, eval = FALSE}
  if (!require(tidyverse)) install.packages("tidyverse")
  if (!require(renv)) install.packages("renv")
  ```
  
## Instructions for Windows users

### Terminal

1. Install [GitBash](https://gitforwindows.org/), which emulates Bash (the Unix shell) in Windows. All command line instructions should be completed in GitBash and not the native Windows Command Prompt.

### Git

1. Basic Git was installed automatically with your GitBash Terminal.
2. Test that Git is properly installed by opening GitBash and typing `git --version` [Enter]. This should populate the window with information on your version of Git such as

```
git version 2.20.1.windows.1
```

3. Once you've installed Git, you'll need to activate it on RStudio:
  * Open RStudio and go to *Tools* > *Global Options* > *Git/SVN*
  * Click *Enable version control interface for RStudio projects*
  * If necessary, enter the path for your Git executable where provided (see picture below).
  * Restart RStudio, if it worked out you will find the Git icon on the top toolbar, as shown below.

4. If you do not already have one, sign up for an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/).
5. Configure your GitHub user name and email (the email address you used to register on GitHub). To do this, open GitBash and type:

```
git config --global user.name 'yourGitHubUsername'
git config --global user.email 'name@provider.com'
```

### Make

1. Download the [latest version of Make](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ezwinports/files/) *without guile*.
  * The file name looks like `make-4.1-2-without-guile-w32-bin.zip`, though the most recent version number may be different.
2. Unzip the folder.
3. Copy all of its contents to `c/Program Files/Git/mingw64/`
  * Merge all of the contents of the folders but do NOT overwrite/replace any existing files.
4. Check that Make is installed by typing `make --version` [Enter] in GitBash. This should populate the window with information on your version of Make such as

```
