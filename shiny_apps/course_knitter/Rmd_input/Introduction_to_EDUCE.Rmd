# Introduction to EDUCE

<img src="images/EDUCE_Globe.png" width="250" ALIGN="left" />
The Experiential Data science for Undergraduate Cross-disciplinary Education ([EDUCE](https://educe-ubc.github.io/)) initiative at the U. of British Columbia creates flexible curriculum in data science. This includes Unix command line, R/RStudio, statistics, and next-generation sequencing analyses. While EDUCE was originally designed for integration into undergraduate microbiology courses at UBC, the content is broadly applicable across many disciplines.

This document was created using our [Course Compiler](https://educe-ubc.github.io/about_compiler.html). Thus, it contains only the courses and content that were selected for inclusion by the user. All our course and workshop materials can also be found on the [EDUCE GitHub](https://github.com/EDUCE-UBC/).
