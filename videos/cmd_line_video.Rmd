The command line / terminal / shell allows you to access a computer using only a text-based window. It is a foundational tool in data science and is used throughout many EDUCE modules.

Here, you will find guided video tutorials covering some basic command line functions and application of these functions using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool ([BLAST](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi)).

## The data
These data were collected as part of an on-going oceanographic time series program in Saanich Inlet, a seasonally anoxic fjord on the East coast of Vancouver Island, British Columbia (Figure 1A). Saanich Inlet is a steep sided fjord characterized by a shallow glacial sill located at the mouth of the inlet, which restricts circulation in basin waters below 100 m (Figure 1B).

During spring and summer months, elevated primary production (like photosynthesis) in surface waters combined with restricted circulation results in progressive water column stratification and complete oxygen starvation (anoxia) in deep basin waters. In late summer, pulses of oxygenated nutrient-rich ocean waters upwelling from the Haro Straight cascade over the sill, displacing oxygen starved bottom waters upward. The intensity of these renewal events varies from year to year with implications for microbial ecology and biogeochemical cycles (Figure 2).

**Figure 2.** Contour plot of water column oxygen concentrations over multiple years in the time series. Warmer colors indicate high oxygen concentrations while cooler colors are low. Note the recurring pattern of oxygen decline below 100 m depth intervals followed by seasonal renewal events in late Summer into early Fall carrying more oxygenated waters into the Inlet.

The seasonal cycle of stratification and deep water renewal enables spatial and temporal profiling across a wide range of water column energy states and nutrients, thus making Saanich Inlet a model ecosystem for studying microbial community responses to ocean deoxygenation. Ocean deoxygenation is a widespread phenomenon currently increasing due to climate change.

In our tutorials, we use data from various geochemical measurements at many depths in Saanich Inlet over time (approximately monthly from 2006 to 2014) as well as microbial data from selected time frames and depths of interest.
