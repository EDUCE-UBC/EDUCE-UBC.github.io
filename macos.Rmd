All instructions in EDUCE materials related to the command-line interface (CLI) assume that you use a particular shell called `bash`. To switch, open the Terminal app and enter the following command after the prompt `$`:

```{bash eval = FALSE}
chsh -s /bin/bash
```

After command finished (i.e. you see the prompt `$` and your cursor again), quit and restart the Terminal app.
