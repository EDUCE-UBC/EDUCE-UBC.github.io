All instructions in EDUCE materials related to the command-line interface (CLI) assume that you use a particular version called `bash` and download files using a program called `curl`.

- To switch, open the Terminal app and enter the following command after the prompt `$` (all distributions):

  ```{bash eval = FALSE}
  chsh -s /bin/bash
  ```
  
  
- Install `curl`

  For Debian-based distributions (e.g. Ubuntu, Linux Mint):

  ```{bash eval = FALSE}
  sudo apt update && sudo apt install curl
  ```

  For RPM-based distributions (e.g. Fedora, CentOS):

  ```{bash eval = FALSE}
  sudo yum update && sudo yum install curl
  ```
