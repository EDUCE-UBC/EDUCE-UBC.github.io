**These instructions are for Windows 10 only!**

## Goal

Many biocomputing tools are only accessible and executed from a Unix-like Command Line Interface (CLI). Out-of-the-box, Windows 10 does not support Unix-like commands, but it is possible to add this functionality. In these instructions, you will:

- Install the "Windows Subsystem for Linux" (WSL).  
  This program allows you to run Linux within your Windows environment (when an operating system is run on top of another operating system, it is called a virtual machine).
- Install the Linux distribution "`r params$linux_version`" from the Microsoft Store.
- Start up "Ubuntu" and create a user account.

## Installing Ubuntu

To install WSL, first [update to the latest version of Windows 10](os.html#windows).

You will have to restart your computer as part of the installation, so make sure to save any changes before you continue.

- Select the Windows Start button > type `powershell` ![](images/one.png){width=3%} > choose "Run as administrator" ![](images/two.png){width=3%} > choose "Yes" in the prompt that opens > enter your administrator password if prompted

- In the PowerShell app, enter the following commands to enable WSL

  ```
  dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart
  ```

  and virtual machines on your system:
  
  ```
  dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart
  ```

- Restart your computer.

- After your restart, download the [latest WSL kernel](https://wslstorestorage.blob.core.windows.net/wslblob/wsl_update_x64.msi) and install it by double-clicking on the file.

- In the PowerShell app, enter the following command to use the latest version of WSL:

  ```
  wsl --set-default-version 2
  ```

- Go to [Microsoft Store `r params$linux_version` website](`r params$linux_version_link`) > click "Get" button to install it

- Time to start Ubuntu for the first time! Select the Windows Start button > type `Ubuntu` and start it. In a new window, a prompt will ask you to create a username (use only lowercase letters and underscores, i.e. `_`, instead of spaces) and a password. You will need this password whenever you install something on Ubuntu, so retain the information somewhere secure. This combination of username and password is specific to the Linux operating system and independent of your Windows username and password. You can exit Ubuntu by entering:

  ```
  exit
  ```

- Back in the PowerShell, enter the following command to make Ubuntu your default for WSL:

  ```
  wslconfig /setdefault `r params$linux_version_cli`
  ```

- Now you can start Ubuntu from the PowerShell by entering:

  ```
  wsl
  ```

- As a final step, we are going to update all installed programs of your new Ubuntu installation. In Ubuntu, enter the following commands:

  ```{bash eval = FALSE}
  sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
  ```
