Many biocomputing tools are only accessible and executed from a Unix-like Command Line Interface (CLI). All instructions in EDUCE materials related to CLI assume that you use a particular shell called `bash`.

### Windows 10

**These instructions are for Windows 10 only!**

Out-of-the-box, Windows 10 does not support Unix-like commands. Fortunately, it is possible to add this functionality by installing "Windows Subsystem for Linux" (WSL) which will allow you to run a Linux distribution (in our case "Ubuntu") on top of Windows. You will have to restart your computer as part of the installation, so make sure to save any changes before you continue.

#### Installation

- First [update to the latest version of Windows 10](os.html#windows).

-   Go to [Microsoft Store Windows Terminal website](https://aka.ms/terminal) > click the "Get" button to install the app.

- Select the Windows Start button > type `terminal` ![](images/one.png){width=3%} > choose "Run as administrator" ![](images/two.png){width=3%} > choose "Yes" in the prompt that opens > enter your administrator password if prompted

- In the Terminal app, enter the following commands to enable WSL

  ```
  dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart
  ```

  and virtual machines on your system:
  
  ```
  dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart
  ```

- Restart your computer.

- After your restart, download the [latest WSL kernel](https://wslstorestorage.blob.core.windows.net/wslblob/wsl_update_x64.msi) and install it by double-clicking on the file.

- In the Terminal app, enter the following command to use the latest version of WSL:

  ```
  wsl --set-default-version 2
  ```

- Go to [Microsoft Store `r params$linux_version` website](`r params$linux_version_link`) > click "Get" button to install it

- Time to start Ubuntu for the first time! Select the Windows Start button > type `Ubuntu` and start it. In a new window, a prompt will ask you to create a username (use only lowercase letters and underscores, i.e. `_`, instead of spaces) and a password. You will need this password whenever you install something on Ubuntu, so retain the information somewhere secure. This combination of username and password is specific to the Linux operating system and independent of your Windows username and password. You can exit Ubuntu by entering:

  ```
  exit
  ```

- Back in the Terminal, enter the following command to make Ubuntu your default for WSL:

  ```
  wslconfig /setdefault `r params$linux_version_cli`
  ```

- Now you can start Ubuntu from the Terminal by entering:

  ```
  wsl
  ```

- As a final step, we are going to update all installed programs of your new Ubuntu installation. In Ubuntu, enter the following commands:

  ```{bash eval = FALSE}
  sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
  ```

- [Create a user account and password for your new Linux distribution](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/user-support)

### macOS

To ensure that you are using `bash` (and not the new macOS default `zsh`), open the Terminal app and enter the following command after the prompt `$`:

```{bash eval = FALSE}
chsh -s /bin/bash
```

After command finished (i.e. you see the prompt `$` and your cursor again), quit and restart the Terminal app.

### Linux

We are going to ensure that you are using `bash` and have a program called `curl` installed to download files.

- To switch, open the Terminal app and enter the following command after the prompt `$` (all distributions):

  ```{bash eval = FALSE}
  chsh -s /bin/bash
  ```

- Install `curl`

  For Debian-based distributions (e.g. Ubuntu, Linux Mint):

  ```{bash eval = FALSE}
  sudo apt update && sudo apt install curl
  ```

  For RPM-based distributions (e.g. Fedora, CentOS):

  ```{bash eval = FALSE}
  sudo yum update && sudo yum install curl
  ```
