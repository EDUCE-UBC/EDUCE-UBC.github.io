# Questions
# 1) Refer to Sample_Collection for table
# 2) Collection of microbial cells from seawater doesn't really represent the actual diversity of microorganisms inhabiting waters along Line-P transect. Some different species were missed

# Questions
# 1) Refer to Sample_Curve for collector's curve for sample
# 2) Curve almost flattens out at approx. 20 individuals
# 3) The shape of collector's curve showed that the depth of sampling is apparently enough to obtain majority of species in original community
