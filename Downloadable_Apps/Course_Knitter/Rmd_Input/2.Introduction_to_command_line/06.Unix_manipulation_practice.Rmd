# Unix manipulation practice
These problems are designed to help you practice concepts and functions covered in the 'Unix manipulation tutorial'.

## Learning objectives

* Use Unix commands to manipulate files including mkdir, cp, mv, and rm
* Apply equivalent file paths in Unix commands
* Define best practices for directory and file names

## Practice

The following exercises use this directory structure and assume your terminal is pointing to the home directory.

1. What are two equivalent file paths for the `results.pdf` highlighted in blue?

2. How would you create a new directory in the home directory named 'project3'?

3. How would you copy the `Saanich.csv` data file from its current location to the new `project3`?

4. How would you move `project2` to `temp`? How would you then delete it from `temp`?
