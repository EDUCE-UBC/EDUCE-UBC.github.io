## R and RStudio

Make sure that you have installed the [latest versions of R and RStudio](r_and_rstudio.html).

## R packages

```{r child = "child_Rmds/packages.Rmd"}
```

Install the following packages by copying the code below into the Console (usually the left or bottom-left pane in RStudio) after the prompt `>`.

```{r install-packages, eval = FALSE}
if (!require(tidyverse)) install.packages("tidyverse")
```

## Data

Download the data files we will use during the class by clicking on the buttons below and save it on your Desktop or another convenient location.
  
```{r echo = FALSE}
downloadthis::download_file(
  path         = "data/growth_data.csv",
  button_label = "Download growth data"
)

downloadthis::download_file(
  path         = "data/well_information.csv",
  button_label = "Download well information"
