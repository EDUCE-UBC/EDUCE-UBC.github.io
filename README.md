# Welcome to the EDUCE website!

Here are the static files for the website.

The default output options for R Markdown are defined in `_site.yml` instead of the YAML header in each individual `.Rmd` document (unless defaults need to be overridden).

The live Shiny Apps for Course Compiler and Data Normalization are located in the private repo on GitHub.

Sample files for novice users can be found under the folder "Sample_Files".
