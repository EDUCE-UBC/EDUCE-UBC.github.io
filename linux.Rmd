All instructions in EDUCE materials related to the command-line interface (CLI) assume that you use a particular version called "bash" and download files using a program called "cURL".

- Switch to the bash command-line interface (all distributions):

  ```{bash eval = FALSE}
  chsh -s /bin/bash
  ```

- Install cURL

  For Debian-based distributions (e.g. Ubuntu, Linux Mint):

  ```{bash eval = FALSE}
  sudo apt update && sudo apt install curl
  ```

  For RPM-based distributions (e.g. Fedora, CentOS):

  ```{bash eval = FALSE}
  sudo yum update && sudo yum install curl
  ```
