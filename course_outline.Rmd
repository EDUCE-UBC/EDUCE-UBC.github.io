# R/RStudio
### Introduction to R
- Introduction
    - Describe general uses for R
    - List several advantages to using R and RStudio
- Download instructions
    - Provides instructions for download and install of R and RStudio
- RStudio tutorial
    - Navigate the RStudio software including key shortcuts, projects, packages, and help
    - All of our R tutorials and practice are implemented in RStudio so we **strongly recommend** that this tutorial be included with all R curriculum
- Base R tutorial and practice
    - Execute commands in base R to:
        - Load tabular data
        - Access columns and rows within a data frame
        - Perform basic calculations on tabular data
        - Subset a data frame

### Data manipulation in R
- Data manipulation tutorial and practice
    - Load tabular data using the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/)
    - Subset and clean data in `dplyr` (filter, select, rename, arrange, mutate)
    - Summarize data in `dplyr` (group_by, summarize)
    - Transform data frames using `tidyr` (gather, spread) and `dplyr` (*_join)
    - Link multiple tidyverse functions using pipes `%>%`

### Data visualization in R
- Data visualization tutorial and practice
    - Define the grammar of graphics
    - Create scatterplots using the `ggplot2` package
    - Customize plot color, shape, axes, scales, and other attributes
    - Represent subsets of data using facets
    - *Recommend first completing 'Data manipulation in R'*

# Statistics *Under development*
### Statistics basics
- Introduces the Central Limit Theorem, p-hacking, and statistical tests relevant to the course material
- Builds from t-tests to ANOVA to linear regression

### Statistics in R
- Applies statistical tests in R/RStudio
- Includes data input, test completion, and interpretation of R outputs
- Can utilize data generated by students in the course or our standard Saanich Inlet dataset
